Project link: [link](https://jeffcai0502.github.io/workshop-task-1/)

## Task
-Make a p5.js sketch using 2D primitive shapes, loops, and random numbers.

-Write your own functions and make calls to these functions in your code.

-Experiment with at least one new item from the from the p5.js documentation Links to an external site.

-Keep notes to clearly document your process and learning.

## Overview
- Moving the rectangle left and right with conditional
- Loop function
- Turn combined shapes into a function
- Learn random positions and heights/size
- Make a drawing

## Workshop Notes
- Main 5 founding priciples :
  - Variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and objects
  - Looking more about variables, conditions then focus on loops and functions.
  
functionmakehouse(xPos, yPos, stories, color)

xPos, yPos are variables

stories means hieght of house

random (0,width) means between 0 and width

random (0, height)

random (0,200)

    
## Workshop Practice Notes:
Making a rectangles(i have set it into a square) that bounce to the oppsite direction after hiting the wall left and right.
  - Moves to the left after X reaches the maximum,
  - Moves to the right after X reaches the minimum.

One way of loop of drawing rectangles, keep drawing until there's a command to say stop.

With different variables, length, width and color.

Adding random to the variables, left and right first(x axies).

More variables are determined by random.

Using one loop two draw two different types of rectangles together to make a simple rain with puddels drawing that continues to change.

Experimented with geometry and random.

Made a "house" under the rainy night.

## New Thing Learnt From p5 Documentation 
- Made a 3d model
- https://p5js.org/reference/p5/model/
