## Task
-Make a p5.js sketch using 2D primitive shapes, loops, and random numbers.

-Write your own functions and make calls to these functions in your code.

-Experiment with at least one new item from the from the p5.js documentation Links to an external site.

-Keep notes to clearly document your process and learning.

## Overview
- Moving the rectangle left and right with conditional
- Loop function
- Turn combined shapes into a function
- Learn random positions and heights/size
- Experimenting with the odd and even for changing the colour

## Workshop Notes
- Main 5 founding priciples :
  - Variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and objects
  - Looking more about variables, conditions then focus on loops and functions.
  
functionmakehouse(xPos, yPos, stories, color)

xPos, yPos are variables

stories means hieght of house

random (0,width) means between 0 and width

random (0, height)

random (0,200)

    
## Workshop Practice Notes:
Making a rectangles(i have set it into a square) that bounce to the oppsite direction after hiting the wall left and right.
  - Moves to the left after X reaches the maximum,
  - Moves to the right after X reaches the minimum.

One way of loop of drawing rectangles, keep drawing until there's a command to say stop.

With different variables, length and color.
